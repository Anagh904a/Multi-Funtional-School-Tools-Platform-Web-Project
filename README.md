# Multi-Funtional-School-Tools-Platform-Web-Project

---

Hi everyone,  
This is our **official GitHub site** for v3 of **School Tools Platform**. Version 1.5 was transformed into **School Tools Platform** after the v2 update. I have created this new repository because a lot of testing will be done, and many bugs and issues will occur during development, which will take some time to resolve.

Now, I have decided to code from scratch for v3, and this major update is expected to release by **January 1, 2025**.  
There are **5 major updates every year**. In 2024, they are:

- **V1** - The release
- **V1.5** - New UI
- **V2** - School Tools Platform
- **V3** - The Ultimate Update

### FEATURES OF V3 (As of October 15, 2024)
- Added non-functional features displayed with a message: *"This feature will be implemented in a future update."*
- Tech update fix
- New organized sections
- New Tic-Tac-Toe game
- New subjects in the quiz and worksheet generator
- Increased length of questions in the worksheet generator
- New AI feature (a simple chatbot for asking doubts, this feature is not yet finalized)
- New Dashboard
- New profile feature
- New Dark theme
- Improved and new UI
